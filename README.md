## 🏞️ US National Park Biodiversity Analysis
This project analyzes species biodiversity across four US national parks, exploring conservation statuses and species observations using pandas, NumPy, and data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
<br/><br/>

### 📊 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to:

- Analyze biodiversity records from US National Parks

- Understand species distribution across categories and parks

- Identify the conservation status of species and its implications

- Visualize trends and observations across various dimensions
<br/><br/>

### 📁 Datasets Used
species_info.csv: Contains species names, categories, and conservation status

observations.csv: Records number of species sightings per park
<br/><br/>

### 🧠 Key Analyses
- Data cleaning, de-duplication, and handling of missing values

- Grouping and pivoting to summarize by category and conservation status

- Merging species data with observation data

- Aggregations across scientific names and parks
<br/><br/>

### 📊 Visualizations
- Bar plots showing:

  - Frequency of species per category

  - Proportion of conservation status per category

- Pie chart of conservation statuses

- Observations per national park

- Boxplot of conservation observations in Bryce National Park
<br/><br/>

### 🧪 Technologies Used
- Python

- Pandas, NumPy — data manipulation

- Seaborn, Matplotlib — data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook / script execution
<br/><br/>

### 📌 Notable Code Highlights
- Pivoting and groupby operations for reshaping data and computing metrics

- Drop duplicates while preserving multiple conservation status entries

- Custom bar stacking to illustrate layered conservation categories

- Annotated boxplots for enhanced statistical insight
<br/><br/>

### 📈 Sample Visual Outputs
- Bar chart: Frequency of species per category

- Log-scale version to highlight less frequent categories

- Stacked bar chart: Proportions of known conservation statuses

- Pie chart: Distribution of conservation statuses

- Boxplot: Conservation observations in Bryce National Park with custom annotations
